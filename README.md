# IN3046: Cloud Computing Coursework

This repo contains the source code for the client implementation of the to-do app for our Cloud Computing coursework.

The front end stack is React with Next.js :globe_with_meridians:

## Getting Started :horse_racing:

After cloning to your machine, you can run `yarn` to install all necessary dependencies. Then you can run `yarn dev` to start the development server, which will start up on http://localhost:3000.

## Generating components & pages :seedling:

To make sure the code stays consistent and structured, always use the provided generators when creating new components and pages. The commands to do that are :point_down:

```bash

# For new component
$ yarn new:component

# For new page
$ yarn new:page
```
